# SoHo XI Directives for Angular

This repository serves as the central shared location for a crowd-sourced cross-Infor Angular Typescript repo of Xi control wrapped components.

  - avoids many teams building the same things - inefficient and asking Xi Team for different flavors of the same thing
  - divide the work to get more done
  - net new teams get huge gains
  - great way to learn new things about angular and typescript, and code/architecture conventions
  - includes wrappers and demos (usage) to get new teams and developers up to speed faster
  - built-in feedback look from dev to H&L and back

This is a working group supported by the core H&L team,  bringing together the various efforts of teams each creating their own angular directives.

The goal is that this will make Angular easier to support for all teams and easier to extend as the library develops and to prevent multiple teams doing the same work. At the moment the project is being shaped during "Knights of the angular table" calls. Contact andrew.lipetzky@infor.com if interested in joining the call its open to anyone how wants to contribute.

The team is using https://slack.com/ for a communication forum.  We have created a [SoHo XI area | http://sohoxi-dev.slack.com/] for discussions related to the components.  There are https://sohoxi-dev.slack.com/messages/general/ and https://sohoxi-dev.slack.com/messages/angular-components/ channels for those discussion topics.  It is becoming more active every day.

## Previous Repos

When we decided on project structure and approach. We collecting and compare repositories for the various teams and use what we all decide is the best. The following repos were considered and discussed.

* http://git.infor.com/users/twallace/repos/angular-components/browse - Tyler (CRM)
* http://git.infor.com/users/ppatton/repos/angular-components/browse - Landmark
* http://git.infor.com/projects/LMS/repos/angular-wrappers/browse - LMS
* http://git.infor.com/users/tharper/repos/sunsystems-reporting/browse - Sun Systems
* http://git.infor.com/projects/INFORCRM/repos/angular-crm/browse - Full CRM Repo
*
Many chose Angular Cli, so this was the resulting decision.
